# Slackiver

Or *Slack-Archiver*, whatever. Basically, set up outgoing hooks on Slack, an
incoming hook to monitor for errors, and this, and all messages can be stored in
a database.

Reference `install.sh` to see how Slackiver is installed. Be sure to update the
versions of OpenResty and LuaRocks it uses, if able.
