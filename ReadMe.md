# Slackive

Or *Slack-Archive*, whatever. Basically, set up outgoing hooks on Slack, and
this, and store all the messages in a database.

For now, reference https://github.com/Guard13007/guard13007.com/blob/master/Deploy.md
for setup instructions, as it is similar. I will right proper instructions as
needed (based on how this is installed where I work).
